# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Use of Filters, PivotTables, and Charts(Including Standard Deviantion, and Interquartile Range)
has provided an in depth summary of the kickstarter data and visulization of trends otherwise difficult
to see.

The first chart shows Failure/Success rate grouped by Category. Three stand out: Film and video / Music / Theater

The 2nd Chart was created to investigate wheather campaign launch date had any impact on its success rate. 
There might be a trend indicated: where high failure counts are shown in Jan/Jul/Oct, and note-worthy successes are in May/June.  
Of note is a divergent in Feb, where success goes up and failure goes down.
Spring/Early Summer Launches do better, many possible reasons may exist but further speculation is outside the scope of this analysis.

For the 3rd Chart an illustration has been drawn from comparing Campaign Goal and amount Pledged.
First of all Outliers have been shown via a Inter Quartile Bar and Whisker Chart.
For this analysis(Great Britain/Musical) 75% of all campaigns total pledges were less than $1,500(successfull or not).
This would suggest campaigns above this amount would have a slim chance of success.
Above $3,000 success rate becomes negligible.
